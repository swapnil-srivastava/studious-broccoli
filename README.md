## Tech

- Nuxt 3
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Pinia
- Axios

## What it does

- Search repos by language
- Filter by date and stars
- Infinite scroll

## Structure

- `components/`: Vue stuff
- `pages/`: Nuxt pages

- `types/`: TS types
- `utils/`: Helper functions

## TODO (ran out of time)

- Better error handling
- Add tests
- Improve accessibility
- Prettier UI
- Add caching
- More filters

## Notes

Lots to improve but it works. Main focus was on functionality over polish. Used Tailwind for quick styling.
